# FemDuWeb-platform
Platform for the socio-economic empowerment of young girls, mainly young girls who are single mothers who have dropped out of school.
## Project Description
This project aims to develop a digital platform for the socio-economic empowerment and well-being of young single mothers in Benin. The platform will offer customized digital skills training, guidance and mentoring tools, a system for connecting with economic opportunities, and health and wellbeing information and support resources.
## Planned technologies
We plan to use the following technologies for the development of the platform:

* **Backend :** Python (with Django or Flask framework)
* **Frontend :** React or Vue.js
* **PostgreSQL or MySQL :** Database
* **Artificial Intelligence (for customization) :** Python Machine Learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch)
* **Repository management :** Git and GitHub
## Current Project Status
The development of the platform is currently in its early stages. This repository will be used to host the source code as it is developed. We plan to share a first alpha version as soon as the first phase of the pilot is completed and we have started the second phase which consists of the creation of the platform.
